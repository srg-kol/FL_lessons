			<p> I have lived for eight years now with my dog, Charlie—a bloodhound who’s embarrassingly bad at tracking
				scents. He greets me jubilantly every time I come home, even if it’s from a quick grocery run. I can hear
				his tail go thump-thump-thump on the floor in the next room when I laugh; he echoes my mirth even when he
				can’t see me. </p>
			<p>Yet, despite sharing this bond, I often sit down next to him on the couch, give him a hug, and ask my wife,
				“Do you think he loves me?” “Yes, yes!” she replies, with only slight exasperation, which is charitable
				because I ask so often. </p>
			<p>This routine is almost like a ritual in our household. I wonder if Charlie has any thoughts about it.
				Looking at him sunning himself on our front porch makes me think about a deeper question: How much do animal
				minds resemble ours? Do other species have thoughts and feelings and memories the way we do? </p>
			<p>As humans, we still think of ourselves as exceptional beings, fundamentally different from other animals.
				Over the past half century, though, scientists have amassed evidence of intelligence in many nonhuman
				species. <a class="link"

				<h2>LIKE FAMILY</h2>
				<p>To observe an octopus, marine biologist David Scheel brought Heidi to live with him and his daughter. As
					Scheel sipped his morning tea, Heidi stretched, yoga-like, in her aquarium. When the family watched TV,
					Heidi watched TV. When they returned home, she swished about. “She was happy to see us,” Scheel says. “Or
					seemed happy.”</p>

				<p>A growing number of behavioral studies, combined with anecdotal observations in the wild—such as an <a
						href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/orca-mourning-calf-killer-whale-northwest-news">orca
						pushing her dead calf around for weeks</a>—are revealing that many species have much more in common
					with
					humans than previously thought. Elephants grieve. Dolphins play for the fun of it. Cuttlefish have
					distinct personalities. Ravens seem to respond to the emotional states of other ravens. Many primates
					form strong friendships. In some species, such as elephants and orcas, the elders share knowledge gained
					from experience with the younger ones. Several others, including rats, are capable of acts of empathy and
					kindness. (Learn more about the hidden world of whale culture.)</p>
				<p>This emerging picture of sentience, of rich inner lives, among surprisingly varied nonhuman species
					represents something of a Copernican revolution in how we view other beings on our planet. Until about
					three decades ago, the minds of animals were not considered a topic worthy of scientific inquiry. “And
					animal emotions—well, that was for romantics,” recalls Frans de Waal, an Emory University ethologist who
					has spent a lifetime studying primate behavior. De Waal was one of the earliest voices advocating for the
					recognition of animal consciousness. Starting a couple of decades ago, he says, scientists began to
					concede that certain species were sentient but argued that their experiences were not comparable to ours,
					and thus not significant. </p>

				<h2>A SENSE OF SELF</h2>
				<p>A Japanese macaque stares at its reflection in a moped mirror. Some monkeys appear to recognize the image
					that they’re seeing as themselves, as do apes. Scientists use the so-called mirror test to determine if
					animals exhibit self-awareness. In humans this attribute develops around 18 months or later.</p>

			<div class="monkey-text">
				<p>Now some behaviorists are becoming convinced that “the inner processes of many animals are as complex as
					those of humans,” de Waal says. “The difference is that we can express them in language; we can talk
					about our feelings.” This new understanding, if it becomes widely accepted, could spark a complete
					rethinking of how humans relate to and treat other species. “If you recognize emotions in animals,
					including the sentience of insects, then they become morally relevant,” de Waal says. “They are not the
					same as rocks. They are sentient beings.” </p>
				<p>The scientific quest to understand the inner lives of animals, however, is still a relatively nascent
					enterprise. It’s also controversial. In the view of some scientists, knowing the mind of another species
					is next to impossible. “Attributing subjective feelings to an animal by looking at its behavior is not
					science—it’s just guessing,” says David J. Anderson, a neurobiologist at the California Institute of
					Technology who studies emotion-linked behaviors in mice, fruit flies, and jellyfish. Researchers
					investigating emotions such as grief and empathy in nonhumans must fend off the charge that they could be
					anthropomorphizing their subjects.</p>

				</div>

				<p>The way to get closer to the truth is to test inferences made from animal behavior, says David Scheel, a
					marine biologist at Alaska Pacific University who studies octopuses. “If you look anecdotally through the
					ages, the notion that dogs are tightly bonded to specific individuals is very clear. But they are
					domesticated. Can a fox do the same thing? Does a wolf have that emotional range? Does an orca feel that
					level of attachment to the members of its own pod? Can a dolphin become friends with a group of fish or a
					scuba diver? Our intuitions lead us astray here all the time. You will get people whose intuition is,
					That’s fake. Whatever it is, that’s not friendship, and other people who think, Well, that’s just silly.
					You are denying animals their inner lives.”

				<h2>READY RECALL</h2>
				<p>A sheep ponders two numbers to pick the one it was taught to recognize. Sheep are good at this. They also
					remember faces, a high-level social skill. University of Cambridge researcher Jenny Morton says that
					although sheep are known to flock, they’re easy to work with when alone. “They trust their handler,” she
					says. “Trust requires emotional intelligence.”</p>

			<div class="sheep-text">
				<p>Just like that invisible “imperative,” primordial emotions like fear prompt particular actions. Even
					though emotions like love and sorrow might seem more profound, they are not qualitatively different. “All
					of our scientific and philosophical work right now,” Scheel says, “is pointing to the idea that any
					emotion you care to name, however lofty and high and ethereal, is built up from these primordial
					emotions.”</p>
				<p>If that’s the case, it’s not hard to appreciate that a wide variety of species—from fleas to
					chimpanzees—have emotions, primal in some and advanced in others.</p>
				<p>The ravens regarded me warily, hopping away when I stepped too close to the wire mesh that separated us.
					Sunlight filtering into the cage shimmered off their silken, jet-black feathers, accentuating their
					sheen. I’d flown all the way from the United States to Austria to visit them because Thomas Bugnyar, a
					behavioral and cognitive biologist at the University of Vienna, had made a remarkable discovery about
					their behavior. After about 10 minutes, the birds seemed to relax. One cautiously shuffled over to get a
					better look at me, turning its head and sizing me up alternately with its left eye, then its right. </p>

				<h2>SHIMMERING MINDS</h2>
				<p>Ravens have remarkable cognitive abilities. Their sharp memories enable them to recall whether a
					particular person is kind or cruel. They display complex emotional abilities, such as consoling ravens
					vanquished in a fight, and are keenly attuned to their role in social networks. They also seem to be able
					to assess what other birds know, a highly advanced level of understanding.</p>

			<div class="raven-text">
				<p>A necessary feature of emotional intelligence—including the capacity to respond to a fellow creature’s
					distress—is the ability to read the emotional state of others. On a windy morning, I stood on the edge of
					a muddy field in the English countryside as psychologist Leanne Proops showed me how she’s testing
					whether horses have this ability. </p>
				<p>It’s evident Proops, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth, loves her study subjects. Throughout
					my visit, every time I saw a horse and remarked how sweet the animal seemed, her smile would widen, and
					her eyes would soften. “Very sweet!” she would reply, invariably. </p>
				<p>We leaned two boards against a fence, each printed with a life-size photograph of a horse’s head seen
					from the front. In one, the horse’s ears were perked up, the nose and mouth were relaxed, the eyes looked
					calm—a content horse. In the other, the horse had a threatening look, with ears pulled back, jaws
					clenched, and nostrils flared. </p>
